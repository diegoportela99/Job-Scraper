## Features 🌟

* Active Proxy Hopping
* Multi-Threaded Proxy Checking
* CSV Local Data Store

## How to run the code 🚀

It's very easy you just need to do the following below!

1. Run requirements.txt
    ```
    python install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. run python indeed_scraper
    ```
    python indeed_scraper.py
    ```
    
### Current Issues

The program does not currently work for other hosted websites as it is hard coded to pull date from indeed, future requirements would be to add an automated version for extrating the text from each endpoint.
